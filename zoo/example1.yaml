# We start to define our global settings

title: "A YAML config example"

# directory path where files will be looked for
dir:  alice/calibration-files/

# if true, sub directories will be searched too
include subdirectories: true

# only files whose filename ends with at least one of these suffixes will be kept
suffixes: [.fits, .fits.gz,.fits.Z]

# AstronomicalDetectors needs to know the integration time.
# we specify which keyword contains this information.
exptime: "ESO DET SEQ1 DIT"

# We start to define our global filters

# This is a filter that will be applied to every file.
# INSTRUME is a keyword name. SPHERE is the target value.
# Only files whose header have INSTRUME keyword with value SPHERE will be kept.
INSTRUME: SPHERE

# Here we want to restrict the files by a range of DateTime for the keyword DATE-OBS.
DATE-OBS:
    min: 2022-04-01                # inferior bound (inclusive)
    max: 2022-04-13T12:24:10.003   # superior bound (exclusive)

# We start to define our categories

categories:
  FLAT:   # a first category, of name "FLAT"
    sources: background + flat   # two sources, "background" and "flat"
    ESO INS COMB IFLT: BB_H      # a filter for this category
    ESO DPR TYPE: FLAT,LAMP      # another

  BACKGROUND:  # another category, of name "BACKGROUND"
    sources: background
    ESO DPR TYPE: ["DARK", "DARK,BACKGROUND"]   # at least one of these values must hold

  WAVE:
    sources: background + wave
    dir: alice/wave-calibration-folder  # changing the `dir` setting for this category
    exptime: "SPECIAL DIT KEYWORD"      # changing the `exptime` setting for this category
    ESO DPR TYPE: ["LAMP,WAVE","WAVE,LAMP"]
